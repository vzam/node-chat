## Introduction
vichat is a simple chat application. It will be based on node.js, communicating via web-sockets with a web interface.
Before beginning, users will have to choose their nickname and the language which they want all messages to be displayed in.
The messages will be translated into the chosen language using an external service. 

Depending on the time which I can dedicate to this project, the users will also be able to choose a chat room and whether they want
to be the only person allowed to send messages when they are the first person to join it.
